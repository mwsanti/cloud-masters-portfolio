# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Computing Masters Portfolio ‚òÅÔ∏è

Welcome to my Cloud Computing Masters Portfolio! This repository showcases practical lab exercises and projects completed during my Masters program in Cloud Computing at the University of Maryland Global Campus. It serves as a comprehensive collection of my hands-on experience across various cloud platforms and essential cloud technologies.

## üöÄ Purpose:
This portfolio aims to demonstrate my practical skills in designing, deploying, and managing cloud-based solutions. Each lab report highlights specific cloud services, tools, and best practices learned throughout the program.

## ‚ú® Key Learnings & Skills Highlighted:
* **Cloud Platforms:** Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates
* **Networking:** VPC/VNet/VPC Networks, Subnets, Internet Gateways, Network Security Groups, Routing
* **Compute:** EC2, Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Compute Engine, Kubernetes, Docker
* **Storage:** S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, Databases (SQL/NoSQL)
* **Security:** IAM, Security Groups, Network ACLs, Identity Management
* **Automation & Scripting:** AWS CLI, Azure CLI, PowerShell, Bash Scripting, Python
* **Monitoring & Logging:** CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Cloud Logging
* **Deployment & CI/CD:** Basic CI/CD concepts, automated deployments

## üìÇ Repository Structure:

This repository is organized by cloud provider, with each provider having a dedicated directory. Within each cloud provider's directory, individual lab reports are contained in their own subdirectories.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aws-labs/                   # Labs focused on Amazon Web Services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ azure-labs/                 # Labs focused on Microsoft Azure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gcp-labs/                   # Labs focused on Google Cloud Platform
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common-cloud-concepts/      # (Optional) Labs covering cross-cloud or foundational concepts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # This file
```

Each individual lab directory (`lab-XX-topic-name/`) contains:
* `README.md`: A detailed overview of the lab, including objectives, technologies used, high-level steps, code snippets, challenges, and key takeaways.
* Original Lab Report: The full `.docx` or `.pdf` document of the lab report.
* `code/`: Directory for all relevant code, scripts, and configuration files.
* `screenshots/`: Directory for visual evidence of successful deployments and configurations.
* `documentation/`: (Optional) Additional notes, diagrams, or supporting documentation.
