# Lab Report 02: AWS CloudFormation for VPC and Internet Gateway Deployment

## Objective:
The primary objective of this lab was to design and deploy an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and an Internet Gateway (IGW) using AWS CloudFormation and its Designer tool[cite: 2]. This included defining resource configurations, adding tags, and managing the stack lifecycle.

## Technologies Used:
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* AWS CloudFormation
* AWS CloudFormation Designer
* AWS VPC
* AWS Internet Gateway
* JSON/YAML (CloudFormation Template Language)

## Key Concepts Demonstrated:
* **Declarative Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Defining infrastructure through templates that describe desired configurations[cite: 10].
* **CloudFormation Stacks:** Managing collections of AWS resources as a single unit.
* **Resource Tagging:** Applying metadata for organization and management[cite: 4, 5].
* **Automated Provisioning:** Allowing the system to automatically determine the steps needed for deployment[cite: 11, 12].
* **Configuration Drift Prevention:** Ensuring consistent deployments and reducing mistakes[cite: 14].
* **Scalability:** Provisioning and managing infrastructure that adapts to changing requirements[cite: 15].

## Implementation Steps (High-Level):

1.  **Access CloudFormation Designer:** Logged into AWS Academy Learner Lab and launched the Designer Tool from the CloudFormation dashboard[cite: 1].
2.  **Design VPC:** Dragged a VPC resource into the Designer tool[cite: 2].
3.  **Configure VPC Properties:** Edited the template to add a CIDR block (`10.0.0.0/16`) [cite: 3] and JSON tags for the VPC name (`CF VPC`)[cite: 4].
4.  **Design Internet Gateway:** Dragged an Internet Gateway into the Designer tool[cite: 4].
5.  **Attach Internet Gateway:** Linked the Internet Gateway to be dependent on the VPC and attached it by dragging connection dots[cite: 4].
6.  **Configure Internet Gateway Properties:** Edited the JSON to add tags for the Internet Gateway name (`CF IG`)[cite: 5].
7.  **Validate and Save Template:** Validated the template and saved it as `CCA625-P2-mws.template`[cite: 6].
8.  **Create Stack:** Uploaded the saved template to the Create Stack wizard and named the stack `CCA625-P2-MWS`[cite: 7].
9.  **Verify Configuration:** Monitored the CloudFormation dashboard for `CREATE_COMPLETE` status and verified resource creation in the AWS VPC service dashboard[cite: 7, 8].
10. **Terminate Resources:** Detached and deleted all created resources upon completion[cite: 8].

## CloudFormation Template Example (Simplified):

This YAML template represents the core resources (VPC and Internet Gateway) and their attachment, similar to what would be designed and generated by the CloudFormation Designer with the specified tags.

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: A simple VPC and Internet Gateway created via CloudFormation.

Resources:
  MyVPC:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
    Properties:
      CidrBlock: 10.0.0.0/16
      EnableDnsSupport: 'true'
      EnableDnsHostnames: 'true'
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: CF VPC # As per lab report [cite: 4]

  MyInternetGateway:
    Type: AWS::EC2::InternetGateway
    Properties:
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: CF IG # As per lab report [cite: 5]

  AttachGateway:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref MyVPC
      InternetGatewayId: !Ref MyInternetGateway

Outputs:
  VPCId:
    Description: The ID of the created VPC
    Value: !Ref MyVPC
  InternetGatewayId:
    Description: The ID of the created Internet Gateway
    Value: !Ref MyInternetGateway
